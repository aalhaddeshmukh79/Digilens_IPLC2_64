Turntable Motor:
-Need Positioner motor API (via Motion class) to set speed (RPM), and direction (CW/CCW)
-Need Positioner motor API (via Motion class) to set absolute position (deg)

Linear Actuator Motor:
-Need LinearActuator motor API (via Motion class) to set absolute position (milli-inchs)
-Revise legacy's relative position move function used with the PID to execute via
  Motion class, or somehow we need to expose the linear actuator motor as a dependency
  for the PID_Ctlr class.
-Need an API (via Motion class) to get/set a "AppSeqRunning" flag
-Need an API (via Motion class) to have ability to update velocity

Oscillator Motor:
-Need Oscillator motor API (via Motion class) to seq rep-frequency (Hz) and amplitude (deviation in milli-inchs)


For all motors (via Motion class)
-Need API to stop/halt motion
-Need API to get current position, velocity, encoder error cnt, etc. (as applicable)
