Sequencer Operation:

After the sequence has been loaded and commanded to run, commands are sent to
the Log Engine to create a log file and start logging data.

The torch motor speed is set according to the sequence file parameter.

The Sequencer is then commanded to start sequence execution - set various
controls and indicators in the Main UI, and also makes sure required constraints
are met; for example, that the current setpoint of the first step is zero.

Then the Sequencer goes to get the first sequence step for execution.

After getting the first step and updating Main UI's sequence related indicators (e.g.
Step Comment, SeqList, etc.), the Sequencer starts the processing routine
indicated below: 

---IF RAMPING---
01. SEQ: SetLockout
02. SEQ: MoveTurntable  (consider PosMode)
    {IF <PosMode=Norm>,
      Set Positioner to current step speed and direction
      Elseif <PosMode=Abs>,
       Set Torch position, set Positioner position}
03. {IF <OscMode=On>,
      Command Osc motor to run at current step freq and ampl
      Elseif <OscMode=Off>, No Op}
04. SEQ: ExecRampSetPoint
Ignore -->  05. {IF <OscMode=ON>, stop Osc motor}
06. SEQ: GetNextStep (and check for last step)

---IF NOT RAMPING---
01. SEQ: SetLockout
02. SEQ: MoveTurntable  (consider PosMode)
    {IF <PosMode=Norm>,
      Set Positioner to current step speed and direction
      Elseif <PosMode=Abs>,
       Set Torch position, set Positioner position}
03. {IF <OscMode=On>,
      Command Osc motor to run at current step freq and ampl
      Elseif <OscMode=Off>, No Op}
04. SEQ: ExecSetPoint
05. SEQ: Hold Set Point for step duration
Ignore -->  06. {IF <OscMode=ON>, stop Osc motor}
07. SEQ: GetNextStep (and check for last step)

The Arc Enable is determined the same way as before from the sequence steps.

If the last step is executed, the Arc Enable relay is set off, and Main UI
indicators are updated, Log Engine is commanded to stop logging, positioner
motor and/or oscillation motor are halted, and weld current is reset
to zero.
